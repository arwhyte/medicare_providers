PLAN A



1. Create state 
2. Create drg
3. Create referral 
4. Create city (based on unique combination -- must create after state. This will create a diff ID for each city/state combo)

5. Create temp address --> this will just be a list of addresses (based on street)
6. Create temp provider --> this will just be a list of provider names (based on )


----

7. Populate all of these with just the unique values based on their unique attributes



---- 


8. Create medicare_final, which has alllllll the foreign keys.
	
	- Pull provider ID 
	- Pull drg ID 
	- Pull city ID 
	- Pull state ID 
	- Pull referral ID




----

9. Create regular address from medicare_final using command I have now,  
	- Pull streets from temp_address
	- Match street from medicare_final, and pull the associated city_id 
	- Final list of columns will be: 
		- Zip
		- City_id 
		- Street 

10. Create regular provider from medicare_final using command I have now 
	- Pull 



----

11. Create provider_drg from medicare_final using: 
 	- Pull drg_id 
 	- Pull provider_id





PLAN B - utilize referral_region 


--- referral_region = city/state combo --- > WRONG. CAN NOT DO. REFERRAL REGION IS BROADER.
